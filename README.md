Test-Divisibility-by-Three
==========================

Testing for exceptions in the common divisiblity by three rule via brute force.

Rule states that for any number which is divisible by three, the sum of its digits is also divisible by three. - One can infer that the digits of each summed number can be continuously summed until the sum is 3, 6, or 9.

Script also checks to see if any number's digits sum to something divisible by three when the number is not divisble by three.

Created a quick test to settle a debate that numbers over a certain number of digits were not bound by this rule.

Given the appropriate computing power, the script runs to infinity without hitting any exceptions.
